#### Do you know how you always wanted to have a clear list of daily temperatures?
#### This is a perfect app for it.
#### All you need to do is input the daily temperature and it will return a list in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
#### The terminal will color in red the hot days, and color in blue the cold days.
### This way you will always know if it was hot or cold last week.

##### Gems required:
```
gem 'paint'
```
```
gem install terminal-table
```

### I hope you enjoyed.
